          <h4>
            Badrinath "Badri" Bansal is the youngest son of a wealthy family in
            Jhansi. In a flashback, it is shown that Badri's elder brother,
            Aloknath "Alok" Bansal was madly in love with a girl and was going
            to leave the family for her because their father disapproved, but
            decided against it after their father Ambarnath "Ambar" Bansal's
            first heart attack. Now Alok is married to Urmila Shukla through an
            arranged marriage and she is not allowed to work despite being very
            intelligent and better professionally trained than Alok himself.
            Alok is also depressed at having to leave his love and be forced
            into a marriage, so he spends a lot of his time drinking. Badri
            fears the same fate for himself and when he sees the beautiful and
            educated Vaidehi Trivedi at a wedding supposedly being looked after
            by her father Mayank, he falls for her immense beauty and charm. He
            eventually becomes obsessed with her and makes it his mission to
            marry her with Ambar's approval.

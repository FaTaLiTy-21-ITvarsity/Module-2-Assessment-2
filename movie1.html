          <h4>
            The planet Krypton is destabilizing from the mining of the planetary
            core. Just before the planet explodes, Krypton's top scientist,
            Jor-El, steals and infuses the genetics codex into his infant son,
            Kal-El, the first naturally born Kryptonian child in centuries.
            Jor-El manages to send Kal-El in a spacecraft toward Earth before
            being killed by General Zod during a coup d'Ã©tat. Kal-El lands in
            Kansas, where he is adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent and named
            Clark. As he grows older, due to his Kryptonian physiology and
            Earth's yellow sun, he develops superhuman powers that Jonathan
            urges him to keep hidden, even refusing Clark's help years later
            during a tornado storm where he loses his life. Burdened with guilt
            over Jonathan's death, Clark travels the globe hiding under various
            aliases seeking a purpose in life.
